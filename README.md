# Family Tree NFT

Blockchains are safe, secure, and impenetrable distributed databases or ledgers that are shared across computer network nodes. Family tree records can be preserved for years without running the danger of harm or loss by adopting blockchain technology. Family tree helps one to know about their family members whom they have never met or known. This increases the bond with the distant family members who are also a part of one's family. One gets to understand the different relationships which are necessary for an individual. So we developed a web application which can create family tree as NFTS easily and store the data on blockchain and making the tree eternal.

The generated family tree NFTs can be transferred from one generation to another so that the next generation can continue expanding their family tree. As the metadata of the family tree would be stored on blockchain, So in future the users would be able select and change the designs of their family tree.

Future users can update their family tree and get a time/date stamping for each event. The Family tree nft app can also be collaborative, allowing all of the many family members living in various locations to view and edit it right away. Another advantage of keeping the data on blockchain is that record of all transactions and updates made to the family tree NFT would be stored in the blockchain making it very easier to track when and who did the changes.

[Family Tree NFTs](https://familytree-a60ad.web.app/) would enable future generations to know about their predecessors and help the existing generation to spread their cultural values/traditions globally without any fear of tampering.

Currently users can use [Family Tree NFT](https://familytree-a60ad.web.app/) app to store family tree NFTS on both Ethereum and Polygon. Family Tree NFT has easy to use and simple UI/UX, Making it easier for every generation to use our app. While creating the family tree, users can use undo button to re-enter details incase of any typo errors avoiding the need for creating the whole tree again. For start, users just need to own a metamask wallet through which the NFT would be deployed. The app can be used through Metamask mobile also, making it easier for the current old generation to quickly and easily use our app.

# Basic flow

```
1) User connects metamask
2) Enter family name and details of the eldest members of that family
3) Adding next generation details by simply clicking node.
4) Once Family Tree is completed, users can mint it on either ethereum or polygon and view it on OpenSea.
